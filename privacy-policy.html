            <h2>About Seed-Snap</h2>
            <p>
                Seed-Snap is an Android app designed to identify the quality of rice seeds, 
                from those in grain form to those that have already germinated. The app uses 
                deep learning models including AlexNet (CNN) for grain identification, 
                Roboflow Object Detection v3 (Fast) for object detection, and YOLO NAS for 
                rice sprout recognition. Users can capture images of rice seeds using the 
                camera or upload images from their device gallery. The app then displays the 
                results of the model inference with bounding boxes around detected seeds and 
                provides clear precision information for each object. This project was 
                developed as part of the annual rice seed research initiative at Semarang 
                Polytechnic.
